#Singly Linked List:

->Each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
->Can only be traversed in one direction.
->Efficient in insertions and deletions (especially at the beginning).

# Doubly LinkedList
->Each node has references to both the previous and next nodes.
->Allows traversal in both directions.
->Uses more memory due to the extra pointer.


# Analysis

| Operation      | Time Complexity |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Add Task       | O(n) (to end)   |
| Search Task    | O(n)            |
| Delete Task    | O(n)            |
| Traverse Tasks | O(n)            |
