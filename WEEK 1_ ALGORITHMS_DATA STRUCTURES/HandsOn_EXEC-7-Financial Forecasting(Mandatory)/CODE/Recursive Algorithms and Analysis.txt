#Recursive Algorithms

-->Recurison is a method of solving problems where a function calls itself as a subroutine.
--> This allows the function to be repeated several times as it breaks down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.

** In financial forecasting, recursion can help model scenarios like compound growth, where each period's value depends on the previous period. 

To calculate the future value we have a formula to ue :
 FV = PV * (1 + r)^n

*TIme complexity:
->The recursive function runs once for each year:
  ->So T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1) â†’ O(n) time complexity.
*Space complexity is also O(n) due to the call stack depth.
