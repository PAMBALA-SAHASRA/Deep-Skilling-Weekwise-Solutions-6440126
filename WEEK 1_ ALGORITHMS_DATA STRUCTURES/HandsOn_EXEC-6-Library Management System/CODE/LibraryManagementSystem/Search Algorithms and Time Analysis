# Understand Search Algorithms
*Linear Search

Definition: Linear search is a simple search algorithm where each element is checked one by one until the target is found.
Best case: O(1) (first element is a match)
Worst case: O(n) (last element or not found)

*Binary Search
Definition: Binary search repeatedly divides a sorted list to find the target. It compares the target with the middle element.
Best case: O(1)
Worst case: O(log n)
Requirement: List must be sorted (e.g., by title).

*Use Linear Search when:

->Data is small
->No time to sort
->Insertions/deletions happen frequently

*Use Binary Search when:

->You can maintain a sorted list
->Youâ€™re searching frequently
->Dataset is large (saves time)
